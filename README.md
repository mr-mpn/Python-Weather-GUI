Here is a step by step guide on how this application works:

1- Obtain all the information about the user with the means of the IP Address:

To do so we use an HTTP Get Request on the ipinfo.io ,

Here is an example of the info reported by https://ipinfo.io  

  "ip": "24.6.61.239",
  "hostname": "c-24-6-61-239.hsd1.ca.comcast.net",
  "city": "Mountain View",
  "region": "California",
  "country": "US",
  "loc": "37.3845,-122.0881",
  "org": "AS7922 Comcast Cable Communications, LLC",
  "postal": "94040"

---------------------------------------------------------

2- Obtain the temperature using Open-Meteo which is an open-source weather API 

---------------------------------------------------------

3- Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The Taipy GUI library provides Python classes that make it easy to create powerful web applications in minutes.
